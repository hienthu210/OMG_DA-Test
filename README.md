# OMG_DA-Test
I did data profiling and exploration in Python, then I imported csv files into PowerBI.
In PowerBI, I checked and transformed data types of columns supposed to be datetime types, then I added some date attributes to do further time-series analysis. 
I identified and created measures in order to visualize the datasets.
Due to shortage of time, I could not fill missing values.
